# Issues and resolutions exampples

## 1
During a data migration project,
I encountered multiple issues with Azure Data Factory.
Certain combinations of source systems and customer data caused bugs.
These issues often mirrored solutions previously developed by other developers.
Documentation of these issues was scattered across various release notes.
This made finding relevant information nearly impossible.

To address this challenge, I set up a Confluence space.
Equipped with a template for documenting issues, including execution ID, sample data, and a summary of the solution.
This approach aimed to prevent redundant efforts and save valuable time.
By avoiding the repetition of previously solved steps, we could focus on new challenges.
